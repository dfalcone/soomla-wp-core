*This project is a part of The [SOOMLA](http://project.soom.la) Framework which is a series of open source initiatives with a joint goal to help mobile game developers do more together. SOOMLA encourages better game designing, economy modeling and faster development.*

soomla-wp-core
===============

The Windows Phone 8 Soomla core module.
When using the SOOMLA framework, you always start by initializing the core module:
```cs
Soomla.initialize("[YOUR SOOMLA SECRET HERE]");
```

This sets up the local on-device database used by SOOMLA.  The secret is used for encrypting the data, make sure to choose a good one.

This core library holds common features and utilities used by all other modules of the SOOMLA framework.
It includes:
* An encrypted key-value storage (SQLite based) for persisting data locally on devices.
* Utilities for `String` and `JSONObject` manipulation.
* Utilities for Logging and encryption.
* `SoomlaEntity` - the base class from which all SOOMLA domain objects derive

SOOMLA modules internally use these features, though we encourage you to use them for your own needs as well.  For example, use our key-value storage for custom game data for usage across game sessions.

Project Config
---

Windows Phone 8:
* Install the Visual Studio extension "SQLite for Windows Phone".
* In Visual Studio Tools->Extensions Search online for "SQLite for Windows Phone".
* The other libraries are NuGets packages, they should be restored automatically.

Windows Universal App 8.1:
* If using Unity3d, the following steps must be performed on the build output solution in Visual Studio.
* Install the Visual Studio extensions "SQLite for Windows Phone 8.1" and "SQLite for Windows Runtime 8.1".
* Make sure the app is split into two projects, one for Windows 8.1 and one for Windows Phone 8.1
* For each project, add the reference extension for SQLite for Windows and Windows Phone respectively.
